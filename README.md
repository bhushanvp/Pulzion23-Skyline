## Middlewares
1. **Producer Middlewares**
   - **register** <a name="producer_register"></a>
      * It takes all the information from the input fields of the 'Registration Page'.
      * Inserts all the information about Producer into the db1.Producers table.
      * Then it inserts the information about the location into the db1.addresses table
      * Upon successful insertions it stores the following session variables :-
        - req.session.username = Producer's Name
        - req.session.id = Company ID
        - req.session.north = North Coordinates
        - req.session.east = East Coordinates
        - req.session.entity = "producer"
        - req.session.isAuth = true
      * And proceeds further
   
   - **login** <a name="producer_login"></a>
      * It takes all the information from the input fields of the 'Login Page'.
      * Checks all the information about Producer into the db1.Producers table.
      * Upon successful checking the databases it stores the following session variables :-
        - req.session.username = Producer's Name
        - req.session.id = Company ID
        - req.session.north = North Coordinates
        - req.session.east = East Coordinates
        - req.session.entity = "producer"
        - req.session.isAuth = true
      * And proceeds further
      
   - **isAuth**<a name="producer_isAuth"></a>
      * It checks the req.session.isAuth variable to check the user is already logged in.
      
   - **createOrder** <a name="createOrder"></a>
      * **IMP** First it checks if there are any available recyclers who recycle that particular waste.
      * Then it checks which recycler is the nearest (within some radius).
      * If no recyclers are present which satisfy the above conditions then it doesn't create any order.
      * Else it creates an order with order_status = number of available recyclers whoc satisfy the conditions.
      * Updates the order status (created/not) in the Producer's dashboard.

   - **executeOrder** <a name="p_executeOrder"></a>
      * This option is visible at the pending verification section.
      * The recycler has to initiate the execution process by clicking on the execute button.
      * The status of order with order_id = id is set as executed by the producer.
      * The order is then set as completely executed.

2. **Recycler Middlewares**
   - **register** <a name="recycler_register"></a>
      * It takes all the information from the input fields of the 'Registration Page'.
      * Inserts all the information about Recycler into the db1.Recyclers table.
      * Then it inserts the information about the location into the db1.addresses table
      * Upon successful insertions it stores the following session variables :-
        - req.session.username = Recycler's Name
        - req.session.id = Company ID
        - req.session.waste_type = Waste Type
        - req.session.entity = "recycler"
        - req.session.isAuth = true
      * And proceeds further

   - **login** <a name="recycler_login"></a>
      * It takes all the information from the input fields of the 'Login Page'.
      * Checks all the information about Producer into the db1.Producers table.
      * Upon successful checking the databases it stores the following session variables :-
        + req.session.username = Recycler's Name
        + req.session.id = Company ID
        + req.session.waste_type = Waste Type
        + req.session.entity = "recycler"
        + req.session.isAuth = true
      * And proceeds further

   - **isAuth**<a name="recycler_isAuth"></a>
      * It checks the req.session.isAuth variable to check the user is already logged in.

   - **acceptOrder** <a name="acceptOrder"></a>
      * It takes all the order_id from the url itself using req.params.
      * It updates the order_status in the orders table as 111.
      * It also updates the recycler_id of the same entry.

   - **executeOrder** <a name="r_executeOrder"></a>
      * The recycler has to initiate the execution process by clicking on the execute button.
      * The status of order with order_id = id is set as executed by the recycler.
      * This makes the order display in the pending verfication section of the producer.
      * The order is then set as executed by the recycler.

   - **rejectOrder** <a name="rejectOrder"></a>
      * The recycler can reject an order by clicking on Reject button.
      * The status of order with order_id = id is set as rejected by the corresponding recycler.
      * This order is never show to that recycler again.
